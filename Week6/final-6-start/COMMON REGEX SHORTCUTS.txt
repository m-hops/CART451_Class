    A number of common character groups have their own built-in shortcuts.
    Digits are one of them: \d means the same thing as [0-9].
  \d	Any digit character
  \w	An alphanumeric character (“word character”)
  \s	Any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, and similar)
  \D	A character that is not a digit
  \W	A nonalphanumeric character
  \S	A nonwhitespace character
  .	Any character except for newline
